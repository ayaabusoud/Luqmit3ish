# Luqmit3ish
Luqmit3ish is a C#-based application aimed at addressing food waste and insufficient food supplies. The application utilizes Xamarin for building the user interfaces, Azure as the database, and ASP.NET for constructing the required API.

## Introduction
Luqmat 3ish is an application that aims to revolutionize the way we tackle food waste and help those in need. The application serves as a platform that connects restaurants and charities, enabling restaurants to easily donate excess food to those who require it. By facilitating the process of displaying available food items, charities can browse and select the food that best suits their needs. Luqmat 3ish not only helps in reducing food waste but also promotes social responsibility and community involvement among restaurants. Charities, on the other hand, benefit from a steady supply of fresh and nutritious food that they can distribute to individuals in need. Through this application, we strive to create a win-win situation for all parties involved, making a positive impact on the world by fighting food waste and hunger.
The goal of Luqmit3ish is to create a seamless experience for individuals, businesses, and organizations to connect and redistribute surplus food resources efficiently. Through this platform, we aim to minimize food waste, promote sustainability, and help address the global food crisis.

## Problem Statement
In Palestine, food insecurity remains a significant issue despite the country's rich culinary culture. Many families struggle to access enough nutritious food while large quantities of food go to waste in the food service industry. Luqmat 3ish addresses this problem by providing a platform where restaurants can easily donate leftover food to local charities and NGOs. This initiative helps in reducing food waste while also providing essential nutrition to individuals facing hunger or food insecurity. By using Luqmat 3ish, we aim to make a positive impact in the local community by minimizing waste and alleviating food insecurity.
